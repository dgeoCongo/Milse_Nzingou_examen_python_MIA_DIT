## Markdown

This is an Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. 

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:


We start with python

```{python libraries}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import duckdb
import pyarrow
duckdb.sql('SELECT * FROM "./titanic.csv"').df()

```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
